        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This work presents a conformal approach to representing infinite 
           regions of spacetime, focusing on Minkowski and Schwarzschild 
           spacetimes. By using conformal mapping, we aim to visualize and 
           explore the entirety of these spacetime structures within finite 
           boundaries while preserving their causal relationships. Such a 
           visualization helps not only in understanding spacetime at infinity 
           but also in studying trajectories, null geodesics, and event 
           horizons in a more comprehensive manner. Our study contributes to 
           the broader goal of constructing diagrams that allow us to represent 
           infinities compactly, facilitating a better understanding of 
           complex spacetime geometries.</div>

    <h2>Penrose Diagram (A Brief Introduction)</h2>

    <h3>2.a Motivation Behind the Penrose Diagram</h3>
    <div class="problem-content">
        <div class="problem-text">
            <p>
                In the early 1960s, the Penrose diagram, originally introduced 
                by Roger Penrose and republished in 2011 as "Conformal Treatment 
                of Infinity," aimed to address a unique challenge: representing 
                infinite spacetime on a finite plane. This approach was 
                particularly relevant for analyzing Minkowski spacetime, where 
                both time and spatial dimensions extend to infinity.
                <p>
                Consider a particle moving along an infinite trajectory from past 
                to future and from negative to positive spatial infinity. 
                Depicting this complete trajectory on a finite diagram without 
                information loss is impossible using traditional representations. 
                Thus, the problem arose of how to "compactify" infinity within a 
                finite structure.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>2.b The Challenge and Approach to Solution</h3>
    <div class="problem-content">
        <div class="problem-text">
            <p>
                Achieving a complete picture of infinity in finite form requires 
                ensuring that no significant information is lost during compactification. 
                The Penrose diagram addresses this by applying a conformal 
                transformation, mapping a physical manifold, such as Minkowski 
                spacetime, to an "unphysical" manifold. This transformation results in 
                a finite boundary in the unphysical manifold corresponding to the 
                infinite extent of the physical spacetime.
                <p>
                For Minkowski spacetime, the conformal factor, denoted Œ©, approaches 
                zero at the boundary of the unphysical manifold. By introducing null 
                coordinates, we effectively achieve a representation where causal 
                relationships remain intact, capturing the essential features of 
                spacetime within finite bounds.
            </p>

    <h3>2.c Diagram Formulation</h3>
    <div class="problem-content">
        <div class="problem-text">
            <p>
                The transformation from null coordinates ùë¢ and ùë£ to compactified 
                coordinates achieves this compactification. Starting with the 
                Minkowski metric:
                <p>
                \[ ds_0^2 = dt^2 - dr^2 -r^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2 \theta . d\phi^2) \]
                
                we perform a coordinate transformation to arrive at a metric suitable for compactification:
                <p>
                \[ ds^2 = dpdq - \frac{1}{4}sin^2(p-q)(d\theta^2 + sin^2 \theta . d\phi^2) \]
                where ùëù and ùëû are bounded and the conformal factor Œ© becomes zero 
                on the boundary. This approach gives a finite representation of infinity, 
                facilitating a complete and accurate representation of null geodesics and causal structure.

    <h2>Schwarzschild Spacetime</h2>
    
    <h3>3.a Motivation for Studying Schwarzschild Spacetime</h3>
    <div class="technique-content">
        <p>
            The Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations is a 
            key concept in understanding black hole physics, as it describes the 
            spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric mass. This spacetime 
            geometry is asymptotically flat, resembling Minkowski space at 
            infinity, and introduces new challenges near the event horizon, 
            where conventional coordinates fail to represent the full 
            structure without encountering singularities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.b Key Results and Challenges</h3>
    <div class="technique-content">
        <p>
            For Schwarzschild spacetime, the line element is given by:
            <p>
            \[ ds^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{r} \right)dt^2 - \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2.d\Omega^2    \]
            where ùëü = 2ùê∫ùëÄ denotes the event horizon, introducing a coordinate 
            singularity. To resolve this, we perform a coordinate 
            transformation, defining the tortoise coordinate ùëü‚àó, which 
            extends ùëü beyond the event horizon, followed by null coordinates 
            ùë¢ and ùë£. This transformation facilitates a more comprehensive 
            analysis of both black holes (Region II) and white holes (Region III).

    <h3>3.c Applying the Penrose Diagram to Schwarzschild Spacetime</h3>
    <div class="technique-content">
        <p>
            To visualize Schwarzschild spacetime in a finite representation, 
            we apply further transformations similar to those used in Minkowski 
            spacetime, resulting in a finite, bounded diagram that accurately 
            represents the entire Schwarzschild manifold. This conformal approach, 
            introduced by Kruskal and Szekeres, maps the infinite ùë°-ùëü coordinates 
            to finite ùëá-ùëã coordinates, avoiding the singularity at ùëü=2ùê∫ùëÄ and 
            preserving causal structures across regions.

    <h3>4.a General Applicability of Conformal Mapping</h3>
    <div class="problem-content">
        <div class="problem-text">
            <p>
                The conformal mapping technique used in this work is 
                not universally applicable to all spacetime geometries 
                but is effective for spacetimes where a differentiable boundary
                can be established. In Minkowski and Schwarzschild spacetimes, 
                the technique preserves the causal structure while 
                compactifying infinity within a finite boundary.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div> 

    <h3>4.b Constraints and Limitations</h3>
    <div class="problem-content">
        <div class="problem-text">
            <p>
                In applying conformal transformations to general manifolds, 
                it is essential that the manifold and metric tensor satisfy sufficient 
                differentiability. Additionally, the conformal factor Œ© must vanish 
                at the boundary without introducing discontinuities. In cases 
                where null geodesics originate and terminate at the boundary, 
                this approach provides a coherent and finite representation of spacetime, 
                allowing for a complete understanding of causal relationships and 
                asymptotic behavior.
